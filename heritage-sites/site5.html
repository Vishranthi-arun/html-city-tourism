<h2>High Line</h2>
<p>This unique linear public park has been planted with a variety of plants and trees, many of which are native species. In spring many of these come into bloom. The park is lined with glass railings in most areas, giving it a natural feel, while still offering outstanding views of the city.

    This oasis on Manhattan's West Side runs from Gansevoort Street at the south end (just south of West 13th Street) to West 34th Street at the north end, running parallel to 10th Ave most of the way. You can access it at various points along the route, some of which offer stair access only, and others with elevator access.
    
    Although the High Line is only about two to three stories above street level, the views of the city's architecture and the lookouts over the streets offer a whole new perspective. Along the route are art installations and benches, and near the south end is a sitting area with bleacher-style seating and a glass wall looking out onto the city. The trail is heavily used, and on weekends it can be extremely busy, but without the surrounding traffic, it's still a peaceful retreat.
    
    One of the highlights of the High Line is the Hudson Yards overlook, called The Vessel, near 34th Street. This is a stunning multilevel structure.
    
    You'll find other interesting places to visit just off the High Line. The south section runs through the Meatpacking District, with plenty of trendy restaurants and fine dining. The southernmost access point is adjacent to the Whitney Museum of American Art, which is also worth a visit.
    
    If you hop off the High Line at the 16th Street access (elevator access), it's just a short stroll to the popular Chelsea Market, located in a former Nabisco factory, where you'll find restaurants and unique shops.
    
    In the spring of 2023, a new extension called the High Line â€” Moynihan Connector opened to much fanfare. This extension adds new access points, public spaces, and transit connections via the Moynihan train station. The new additions consist of two new 600-foot-long bridges, one made of steel and one made of wood.
    
    Tours of the High Line are offered year-round and trace the history of the attraction from its industrial beginnings through to the structure it is today. Tours are free and are 90 minutes long in the spring, summer, and fall, and 45 minutes long in the winter.
    
    Although a late-night stroll on the High Line on a hot summer's night or after a concert or Broadway show may sound enticing, the High Line closes at 10pm.
