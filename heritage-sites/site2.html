<h2>Central Park</h2>
<p>An oasis of green amongst New York's concrete canyons, Central Park is a sanctuary of peace and quiet for visitors and locals alike.

    A walk, pedal, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on anyone's New York City itinerary. In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.
    
    Besides being a great place to experience a little nature, Central Park has many attractions within its borders, and most of them are free, making it one of the few cheap things to do in NYC. Some of the most popular places to visit include the Belvedere Castle, Strawberry Fields, the Central Park Zoo, and the Lake. If you are exploring the park on your own, start by picking up a map at one of the visitor centers and plot your route.
    
    Central Park also offers activities throughout the year, from 5km runs and yoga classes to penguin feeding at the Central Park Zoo. Have a look at the park's events schedule for details on what's happening during your visit.
    
    If you're visiting during the summer months, you may want to catch a performance of Shakespeare in the Park at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. This is a relaxing way to spend an evening in New York City and performances are free.</p>
